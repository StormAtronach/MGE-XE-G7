// XE Mod Water Volume.fx
// Surfaces of water volumes: meshes the game submits, shaded like the water plane.
// Uses the vertex shader, samplers and helpers of XE Mod Water.fx.

// A volume can sit at any height and its surface can face any way, so the planar reflection
// of the main water does not apply to it. The sky is reflected from its analytic colour, and
// what is on screen is reflected by marching the reflected ray through the depth frame.
// The shading follows the normal of the mesh: the ripples are tilted to it, and the reflection
// and the Fresnel term are taken from it.

// A mod can replace the pixel shader of a surface with one of its own: see WaterShade below
// and docs/water-shaders.md.
