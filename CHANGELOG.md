# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Distant statics now stream in and out as you travel instead of all loading at startup.
  This means VRAM usage no longer scales with the size of your mod list.
- Camera-relative rendering, opt-in (`render.camera_relative`). Far from the map origin,
  objects, terrain edges and the whole scene shimmer as the camera moves because the game's
  float32 world coordinates round by a visible amount. The near scene is now combined with the
  camera in double precision, relative to the exact camera position, so that rounding never
  reaches the screen. Actors, creatures and the first-person arms are placed from the exact
  positions their skeletons imply rather than the engine's rounded ones, which stops their
  trembling far out. `render.camera_relative_probe` logs the measured error every 300 frames.

### Changed

- Sun shadows are rebuilt. Casters render into a hardware depth atlas read with
  percentage-closer compares instead of a blurred exponential map, in four cascades (1000,
  4000 and 16000 units, then the draw distance) instead of two, and distant terrain and
  statics now receive shadows as well as cast them. Two atlases are cross-faded in time, so
  shadow edges move continuously as the sun turns instead of hopping, and a teleport or a
  load rebuilds them at the new position within a few frames. Shadows follow the sky light
  the engine lights with rather than the sun disc, so they agree with the shading and with
  the engine's own actor shadows at every hour. New `distant_land.shadows.static_range`
  (cells, default 4, 0 for no limit) bounds how far from the camera distant statics cast;
  terrain always casts over the whole draw distance. The eight core shaders under
  `Data Files\shaders\core` must be updated with the DLL.
- Distant statics use about 23% less video memory and disk space.
- `MGE_DL_VERSION` 17 to 18. Distant land must be regenerated after updating.

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash caused by the distant object list being read one entry past its end, drawing a
  leftover object from an earlier frame. The bug predates the fork; it only became a crash once
  distant statics started streaming.
- Water reflections no longer render half-finished for a frame when distant land is busy.
- The generator's memory warnings no longer count streamed geometry against your card, so large
  installs stop being told to reduce settings that are fine as they are.

## v0.20.3 beta

### Fixed

- Fixed some distant objects receiving incorrect vertex colors.

## v0.20.2 beta

### Fixed

- Fixed distant land generation and loading for non-English interior cell names.
- Fixed handling of grass mods that place statics defined in a master file (such as Tamriel Data).

## v0.20.1 beta

### Fixed

- Reduced memory use while generating distant land, hopefully preventing crashes with very large
  mod lists ([#3](https://github.com/Greatness7/MGE-XE/issues/3)).
- The configuration utility no longer fails to launch when ReShade is installed
  ([#4](https://github.com/Greatness7/MGE-XE/issues/4)).
- The configuration utility no longer needs administrator rights to save display settings, and now
  shows the same resolution the game and the Morrowind launcher use.
- The configuration utility now detects groundcover mods that use grass only defined in master files.
- Fixed sun shadow flickering at the bottom screen corners and at the cascade intersection.
- Skinned meshes, such as the hanging banners in Vivec, are now included in distant statics
  ([#1](https://github.com/Greatness7/MGE-XE/issues/1)).

## v0.20.0 beta, G7 fork

First public release of the G7 fork, based on MGE XE 0.19.1. Requirements, installation and feature
detail are in [README.md](README.md).

### Added

- Batched distant land. The generator merges each cell's geometry into one mesh split by texture
  state and packs static textures into atlases, so a cell costs one or two draw calls rather than
  one per object.
- Incremental regeneration. Only dirty cells, changed shards and touched atlas pages rebuild.
- Plugin `-metadata.toml` files are detected and loaded, so mod authors ship distant-land overrides
  and dynamic visibility with the mod instead of documenting install steps.
- Distance-tiered detail for statics: three triangle budgets per object instead of one fixed mesh.
- Horizon culling for statics and terrain, on by default.
- Automatic texture sizing and deduplication, with VRAM estimates and warnings during generation.
- Native depth capture, on by default (`native_depth_capture`). MGE reads the real depth buffer
  instead of redrawing the scene, which also fixes objects vanishing from scenes that use darkmaps
  with transparency.
- Native per-pixel lighting, on by default (`native_ppl_packets`). Lighting data goes straight to
  the GPU instead of through the legacy shader path.
- Up to 32 lights per object, opt-in (`expanded_light_limit`). Needs `native_ppl_packets` to reach
  per-pixel-lit objects.
- BC7 texture support, for finer detail and compatibility with OpenMW mods.
- Indexed skinning for meshes, opt-in and undertested (`indexed_skinning`).
- Native GUI with a dark theme, a tabbed generator window, four languages (EN/FR/PL/RU), a built-in
  log viewer and automatic startup rebuilds. Grass mods are detected and listed separately from
  plugins, and the distant-land tuning controls are new. No .NET runtime required.

### Changed

- Settings live in `mgeXE.toml` in the game root, replacing MGE3 and `MGE.ini`. You can edit it by
  hand, and your comments and formatting survive a GUI save. Nothing migrates from 0.19.1.
- `MGE_DL_VERSION` 7 to 16. Distant land data is incompatible with upstream in both directions, and
  the runtime rejects it rather than rendering it.
- Landscape rewritten. Texture quality no longer degrades as landmass mods are added and no longer
  depends on world size, and the geometry is finer.
- Distant landscape uploads in frame-budgeted chunks during load and menu frames.
- Terrain index data uses the narrowest width each mesh allows, and grass vertices went from 28 to
  20 bytes. Both upload without a conversion pass.

### Removed

- The C# WinForms GUI, the C++ helper process and the MSBuild build system.
- The vendored `3rdparty/` tree: niflib, AMD Tootle and the 4 GB patch. NIF parsing and mesh
  optimization are Rust crates now (`tes3`, `meshopt`).
- The bundled MWSE and its updater, the installer and the uninstaller.
- The DirectX capabilities viewer, static override template generation, the tooltip reading-speed
  preference and the "reduce texture memory use" toggle.

### Requirements

- A custom DXVK build ships as `d3d9.dll` and is required. Do not substitute an official release.
  Stock DXVK lacks the memory-placement profile that prevents out-of-memory crashes in Morrowind's
  32-bit address space, and it cannot load BC7 textures.
- Vulkan 1.3 hardware (NVIDIA Maxwell, AMD Polaris, Intel Iris Xe or Arc and newer) on 2023 or newer
  drivers, 64-bit Windows 10 1809 or later, an SSE4.2 CPU, and 8 GB or more VRAM for large mod lists.
- The DirectX June 2010 redistributable and the Visual C++ runtime.
- An SSD holding your game data. Not strictly required, but generation is painful without one.
- Distant land must be regenerated after installing.
