// Camera-relative rendering for the Morrowind near scene.
//
// Far from the world origin, Morrowind's world-space coordinates are large
// enough that float32 arithmetic on them rounds by a visible amount (one float
// step is 0.0625 units at 64 cells out). The rounding happens in three places
// before a vertex reaches the screen: the engine's scene-graph update rounds
// every node's world translation; the engine's view matrix and skin palette
// are composed in float at that magnitude; and MGE XE multiplied world by
// view in float. This module rebuilds all of that relative to the exact camera
// position, in double precision, at the points where the engine's float
// transforms become D3D matrices. The scene graph and every other consumer of
// world-space data are never written.
//
// Exact positions come from the scene graph's own inputs: a node's world
// translation is the sum, down its parent chain, of each local translation
// rotated and scaled by the parent's stored world rotation and scale. Local
// translations are small and exact, and rotations do not degrade with
// distance, so that sum in double is exact where the engine's stored float
// world translation is not. Results are memoized per scene, so a skeleton is
// walked once however many body parts hang from it.
//
// Space convention while the world or first-person scene is active:
//   - the real device and MGE's FFE/PPL shaders see world matrices whose
//     translation is (world - camera) and a rotation-only view;
//   - RenderedState::worldTransforms stays absolute for the passes that replay
//     Morrowind geometry against MGE's own absolute view (sky, water);
//   - DistantLand::mwView stays absolute through absoluteView().
// View space itself is unchanged: the camera is at the origin either way, so
// every consumer of view-space positions (depth, shadow receivers, lighting) is
// unaffected.

// per-bone positions), and the PlayerAnimController camera update call sites
// (exact first-person eye). One-shot for the process lifetime, so turning the
// option on takes a restart; turning it off applies from the next scene. Every
// site verifies what it replaces, and a group that cannot claim all of its
// sites restores the ones it took and reports itself uninstalled. That
// rollback is best-effort: it does not re-check its own writes, which can
// only fail if VirtualProtect refuses a page this module already wrote.

// pose's rotation; deactivates otherwise. Which scene a pose belongs to is
// decided by the NiCamera the engine clicked, never by the shape of a matrix.

// at each view and each LightEnable whether that still matches; when it does
// not, it uploads the recorded light again. Only worth calling while
// installed(); the records are read by nothing else.
//
// `accepted` is whether the device took the upload, so record after the call:
// the absolute light is kept either way and a retry carries the engine's
// latest parameters, while only an accepted upload advances the space and
// origin the device is believed to hold. A rejected positional light stays
// stale and is retried at the next view or LightEnable; a rejected directional
// one is not, since it is never rebased and the device copy is then left
